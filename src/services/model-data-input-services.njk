title: "Model Data Input Services"
headline: "Comprehensive data input for Revit models, creating a single source of truth for all project information."

description:
  - "Revit models are data-rich environments designed to consolidate all project information into a 'single source of truth.' Data input involves adding both geometric information (the physical model elements) and non-geometric information (parameters, properties, metadata)."
  - "Our model data input services ensure that every element in your BIM model is accurately documented with comprehensive data. We populate models with detailed parameters, specifications, and metadata that support analysis, scheduling, and facility management throughout the building lifecycle."

benefits:
  - "Single source of truth for all project data"
  - "Comprehensive parameter and metadata input"
  - "Enhanced model intelligence and usability"
  - "Improved facility management capabilities"
  - "Better decision-making with accurate data"
