title: "Point Cloud Survey"
headline: "Advanced 3D laser scanning and photogrammetry for accurate spatial data capture and BIM modeling."

description:
  - "A point cloud survey is an advanced method of spatial data capture that uses 3D laser scanning (LiDAR) or photogrammetry to collect millions of data points from a physical space or object. These data points create a highly accurate digital representation of the surveyed environment."
  - "Our point cloud survey services provide precise, high-resolution data that serves as the foundation for BIM modeling, renovation projects, and detailed analysis. We use state-of-the-art laser scanning technology to capture complex geometries with millimeter-level accuracy."

benefits:
  - "Millimeter-level accuracy for precise measurements"
  - "Rapid data capture of complex environments"
  - "Non-invasive scanning with minimal disruption"
  - "Foundation for accurate BIM model creation"
  - "Versatile data for multiple applications"
