  "description": [
    "A point cloud survey is an advanced method of spatial data capture that uses 3D laser scanning (LiDAR) or photogrammetry to collect millions of data points from a physical space or object. This technology creates highly accurate digital representations of existing conditions.",
    "Our point cloud survey services provide precise spatial data for BIM modeling, renovation projects, and facility management. We use state-of-the-art laser scanning equipment to capture detailed information that serves as the foundation for accurate digital twins and construction documentation."
