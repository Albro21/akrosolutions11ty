    "Building services coordination, often synonymous with MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) coordination, is the crucial process of integrating the design and installation of all building systems within the architectural and structural constraints of a construction project.",
    "Our coordination services ensure that mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems work harmoniously together while fitting seamlessly within the building's architectural design and structural framework. We use advanced BIM technology to identify and resolve conflicts before they become costly construction issues."

  "benefits": [
    "Early identification and resolution of system conflicts",
    "Reduced construction delays and cost overruns",
    "Improved collaboration between trades and disciplines",
    "Enhanced system performance and efficiency",
    "Compliance with building codes and regulations"
