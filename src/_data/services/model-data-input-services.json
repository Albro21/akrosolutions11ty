    "Revit models are data-rich environments designed to consolidate all project information into a 'single source of truth.' Data input involves adding both geometric information (the physical model elements) and non-geometric information (parameters, properties, metadata) to create comprehensive BIM models.",
    "Our model data input services ensure that your BIM models contain all necessary information for effective project management, quantity takeoffs, scheduling, and facility management. We meticulously input data according to industry standards and project requirements."
