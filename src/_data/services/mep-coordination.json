    "MEP coordination is the critical process of systematically integrating a building's Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing systems within the architectural and structural constraints of a project. It ensures that all building systems work harmoniously together without conflicts or inefficiencies.",
    "Our MEP Coordination services provide comprehensive integration of HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and other building systems. We use advanced BIM technology to identify potential conflicts early in the design phase, ensuring smooth construction and optimal building performance."
