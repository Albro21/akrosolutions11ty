    "FRA1W is one of the most modern and sustainable data centers in Europe, located in Mainz, Germany. The first of three data center buildings on a site area of <span class=\"text-akro-3 font-semibold\">25,000 square meters</span>, which will house a total output of <span class=\"text-akro-3 font-semibold\">80 MW</span> on <span class=\"text-akro-3 font-semibold\">18,000 square meters of whitespace</span>.",
    "This facility is directly connected to Mainz's district heating network, transforming digital heat into green heat. The data center heats cooling water to around 30°C, a large heat pump raises the temperature to up to 125°C, and the heat is fed into Mainz's district heating network via heat exchangers. The system provides <span class=\"text-akro-3 font-semibold\">up to 60 MW of waste heat</span> for the Mainz district heating network, making a significant contribution to the decarbonization of district heating.",
    "The data center operates with green electricity from renewable energy sources and features Rhine water cooling. The emergency power supply is provided by on-site power plants, eliminating the need for expensive and climate-damaging diesel generators, making the data center <span class=\"text-akro-3 font-semibold\">emission-free</span>.",
    "Built exclusively to <span class=\"text-akro-3 font-semibold\">Level 3 standards</span>, all systems are redundant, ensuring extremely high availability. The strategic proximity to the Frankfurt Internet Exchange (DE-CIX) and optimal location on the Ingelheimer Aue provide excellent connectivity and infrastructure advantages."
